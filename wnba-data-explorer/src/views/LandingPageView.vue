        { title: "Player Skill vs. Salary", description: '<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 1.5rem;"><li style="padding-bottom: 0.75rem;">WNBA players have been working towards more equitable compensation ("Pay Us What You Owe Us"), especially in comparison to their league counterparts, the NBA. In fact, while the average salary in the NBA is about $11+ million, the WNBA average salary is only about $100,000. And, while the NBA players\' cut of the NBA revenue is around ~49-51%, the WNBA player\'s cut is only around ~9-10% (Anderson, 2025).</li> <li style="padding-bottom: 0.75rem;">These charts were designed to understand fair and equitable compensation in the WNBA and to identify how skill level, games won, time in the league, and contract types can influence pay.</li> <li style="padding-bottom: 0.75rem;">We can see from the Weighted Skill Score vs. Salary by Player scatterplot that contract types can significantly influence play. For example, even highly skilled players such as Caitlin Clark and Angel Reese are paid within the $70,000-80,000 range simply because they are Rookies. From the Player Weighted Skill Score and Salaries Over Time chart, we can see that many Rookies begin their careers in this salary range, but see a steady increase over time (reflected by their tenure on teams and in the league). For example, this is the case with players like A\'ja Wilson, who began her career with a ~$70,000 salary, but now has moved up to $200,000+. This is proportional to her skill level, as she has consistently been one of the top players in blocks, rebounds and points, as displayed in the Distribution of Players Across Weighted Skill Score, Salary, Assists, Blocks, Steals, Points & Rebounds chart. Other players with relatively lower weighted skill scores and salaries are often on Hardship contracts, which are usually short term and for replacement players when others are injured.</li> <li style="padding-bottom: 0.75rem;">Similarly, the amount teams spend on player salaries is not always proportional to the number of games they win, even though we may expect it to be. For example, in the 2025 season, Seattle Storm spent the most money on player salaries, but had a relatively medium to low number of games won. In fact, teams like Las Vegas Aces, and especially Connecticut Sun, spent less but won more.</li> <li style="padding-bottom: 0.75rem;">These charts provide valuable information on how player and team salaries have changed over time, as a reflection of their skill-level, contract type, etc. As a whole, however, they do indicate that salaries are not always based on the most fair or equitable methods, and that there is still plenty of room for the WNBA to improve its compensation practices.</li> </ul> Sources: Anderson, W.

        { title: "Schedule Fatigue", description: '<p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;"><br />The WNBA as a league has grown by leaps and bounds since its inception in 1996. Founded with only 8 teams with a 28 game schedule, the league currently includes 13 teams playing a 44 game schedule, with a plan to expand to 18 teams by 20301. Each WNBA season has consistently been played in the same time range, from mid-May to early-September. </p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Using the data available to us (from the 2003 season to the 2024 season), we wanted to explore whether the growing size of the league and expanding franchise locations have caused teams to have to navigate differences in scheduling, whether that be having to play more “back-to-back” games (playing games on two consecutive days) or having to travel more from game to game relative to other teams. </p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">First, in looking at “back-to-back” games, the league has seen a decline in such games in more recent years. Starting with 46 such games in 2003, there was then a peak of 68 back-to-back games in 2006. More recently, 2021 had only one such game, whereas in the most recent season there were 24 games, suggesting a slight uptick as the league has expanded its season length, albeit less than at its peak in earlier seasons. </p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">This is important as teams tend to lose back-to-back games more often. While in the first few seasons teams saw win rates of back-to-back games upwards 50%, the overall win rate for back-to-back games is only 44%, with a low of 27% for the 22 back-to-back games played in 2013. </p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">On the whole, teams have not had to travel any more than they used to, with the average team traveling 615 miles from game-to-game in 2003, raising slightly to 646 miles from game-to-game in 2024. </p> <p style="margin-bottom: 0.75rem;">Looking at individual teams, it does seem as though teams in the Midwest and Western regions tend to travel more. This is likely due to the fact that teams in these regions are put together in the same “Western Conference” and have more games scheduled against each other, even though their franchises cover a much larger swath of the country compared to the “Eastern Conference” teams which are mainly concentrated along the Eastern Seaboard. However, this does not seem to have a negative impact on win %; year-over-year, there does not seem to be a strong correlation between back-to-back games played and win % (-0.03 Pearson coefficient) nor between total distance traveled and win % (-0.05 Pearson coefficient).</p> <p className="text-gray-600"> 1 Lewis, Russell (June 30, 2025).

        { title: "Shooting Trends", description: 'Looking at play-by-play for all players and all teams between the years 2003 and 2024, we were interested in exploring how—if at all—play style has evolved. In particular, we focused on shooting plays, which we believed would be most susceptible to evolution as the league grew. In general, we saw a trend towards more aggressive offensive plays, increases in the diversity of shooting plays, and some interesting behavior around the Jump Shot—one of the most common and versatile shooting plays. Notably: <ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 1.5rem;"> <li style="padding-bottom: 0.75rem;">The Jump Shot has long been the most common play on the court. In fact, 2023 saw the Jump Shot rise to a new level of popularity, almost doubling from ~13,000 shots per season in 2022 to ~23,000 shots per season. Given that the total number of teams in the league did not significantly change during this period, this may be indicative of a more fundamental shift in play style towards more aggressive offensive playing.</li> <li style="padding-bottom: 0.75rem;">The Jump Shot has also seen a broader trend—along with many of the other traditionally distance-based plays—towards further shot attempts. The average distance from the Jump Shot play in particular has almost doubled from around 12 feet in 2003 to nearly 23 feet in 2024. Once again, this may be indicative of players moving towards more aggressive and riskier offensive plays (or perhaps a maturing talent base in the league).</li> <li style="padding-bottom: 0.75rem;">Interestingly, despite what appears to be a trend towards more aggressive playstyles, the success rate of most plays has stayed relatively the same over the course of the last two decades (increasing only slightly across all plays). This is more likely a consequence of looking at the data in aggregate, and we saw much more variance in scoring rate for individual players (where the effects of skill and experience are much more pronounced).</li> <li style="padding-bottom: 0.75rem;">Over the last four years (2020 - 2024), there has also been an unprecedented increase in the apparent diversity of shooting plays made during the season. Before 2020, a handful of plays (free throws, layup shots, and jump shots) accounted for the majority of shots taken (over xx%). However, in recent years the distribution of shots has become less concentrated—or so it would seem at first glance. What actually appears to be happening is that these foundational shooting plays spun off into a bunch of unique variants (such as the “Turn Around Fade Away” jump shot). Though this coincides with a general trend in the increase of unique play types (roughly doubling from around 60 in 2003 to around 120 2024), this observation is likely an artifact of the data recording procedure changing in 2020 (becoming more granular).</li> </ul>' },
        { title: "Interesting Plays", description: '<ul style="list-style-type: disc; padding-left: 1.5rem;"> <li style="padding-bottom: 0.75rem;">Jump shots have consistently been the clutch play that teams have relied on most, and this has been true over time. This is followed by free throws and lay ups, which have been used roughly equally.</li> <li style="padding-bottom: 0.75rem;">The game has become a bit more physical over time, with many teams seeing the average fouls per game increase over the years</li> <li style="padding-bottom: 0.75rem;">These charts provide valuable information on how the types of plays teams rely on have evolved over time. In general, they indicate that the game is more fast paced and physical than it was in the past, with teams relying more on jump shots and physicality to win games.</li> </ul>'}
