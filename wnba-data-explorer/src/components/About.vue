                Thank you for visiting our website! We wanted to create a platform to help 
                new and experienced users alike understand how the Women’s National 
                Basketball Association (WNBA) has changed over time. We want this tool to 
                be interactive and explanatory, helping users answer questions ranging 
                from how shot types have changed over time, to whether there is a 
                relationship between salary and overall “skill”, to even questions about 
                which teams perform best in the “clutch”.
